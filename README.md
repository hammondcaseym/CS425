Final Project Things

This is a small game that resembles a thief simulator. The goal (at the moment) is to grab the item in the room before the Guards can catch you. The game is lost when the guards catch you and you can no longer move.

I plan to evolve this game into something much bigger for my next semester's overarching project. This is definitely in its very early stages so please be kind :)

To do this project, I used Unity. This is my first time using Unity, but many tutorials later and I have this game that I am really proud of! I have implemented a few things that we learned in class, including behavior trees and A* search. I use A* Search when the guards spot the player, and you can see it in this project as the pink lines that appear! I am very proud that this ended up working out, as I pulled a lot of my code from my 3rd project of this year--and transferring that to Unity was no cake-walk!

Please enjoy this little game, I hope it brings you as much joy as it brought me making it--and I can't wait to bring more to this Thief Simulator.
